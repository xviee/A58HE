# A58HE - Open Source 50% Alice-Like Analog Keyboard 
Havent ordered pcb's yet due to it's whopping price of ~~$150.
With this project I'm trying to achieve making the first working ergo analog keyboard.
Made layout from using already exsisting kle.json of 40% alice keyboard and modifying it.
# Disclaimer
This project is still work in progress. I dont know if prototypes will be in a working state, so please, do not try to order pcb's.I am not an electrical engineer and i have a little knowledge on hall effect keyboards theme, so my design is probably not working. If you want to create your own analog keyboard pcb, please be aware, that trying to reference my design will likely result in your pcb not working.
